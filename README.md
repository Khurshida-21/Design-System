### Design System Task – README Explanation

Overview
This task focuses on creating a basic design system for a luxury skincare brand to maintain visual consistency and clarity across UI designs.

## What I Have Done
In this design system, I have created the following core elements:

 - Color Palette
    Defined primary, secondary, background, and text colors to reflect a clean and luxury skincare brand identity. These colors help maintain consistency throughout       the design.

 - Typography
    Selected and structured typography styles for headings and body text to ensure readability and a premium look across all screens.

 - Buttons
    Designed primary and secondary button styles with consistent colors, spacing, and border radius to support clear user interactions.

## Purpose
The goal of this design system is to establish a reusable and consistent foundation that can be applied to future UI designs, making the design process more efficient and visually aligned with the brand.
